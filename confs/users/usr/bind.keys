# The bind.keys file is used to override the built-in DNSSEC trust anchors
# which are included as part of BIND 9.  As of the current release, the only
# trust anchors it contains are those for the DNS root zone ("."), and for
# the ISC DNSSEC Lookaside Validation zone ("dlv.isc.org").  Trust anchors
# for any other zones MUST be configured elsewhere; if they are configured
# here, they will not be recognized or used by named.
#
# The built-in trust anchors are provided for convenience of configuration.
# They are not activated within named.conf unless specifically switched on.
# To use the built-in root key, set "dnssec-validation auto;" in
# named.conf options.  To use the built-in DLV key, set
# "dnssec-lookaside auto;".  Without these options being set,
# the keys in this file are ignored.
#
# This file is NOT expected to be user-configured.
#
# These keys are current as of January 2011.  If any key fails to
# initialize correctly, it may have expired.  In that event you should
# replace this file with a current version.  The latest version of
# bind.keys can always be obtained from ISC at https://www.isc.org/bind-keys.
